# QuoteBoard
Quote of the day/hour board for displaying quotes from your team

The board should have the following features:
* Display a quote with a Name, (optional) Date, and (optional) Context that updates at a configurable time interval.
* The ability to update from a source (starting with Google Sheets) when connected to the internet.
* The ability to switch to a "Safe Mode" that hides the quotes when people are visiting that you don't want to see the quotes.
* On a person's birthday, select from their quotes to celebrate their special day.
